<summary>Q. Why do trends exist in the first place?</summary>
<br>  
Ans>>				
Why trends exist: because fundamenally price needs to change. Price movements within the trend are noise, but when fundamentally there is more supply of, say, crude oil in the world than demand, price needs to go down. It does so by trending down. If a stock is undevalued, while the business is developing and dividends are being paid, there will be more people moving into this stock, so it must appreciate. There is no other way to do it in the market, except by trending.

Now for the fun part.

On a shorter time scale, “trends” become more and more random - what looks like a trend is in fact just a statistically uneven distribution. Here’s how it works - if you flip a coin at the frequency of market transactions of a relatively high-liquidity instrument (let’s say 2–3 transactions per second) for a working day (7 hours), you will have about 1200 flips. Inevitably in this amount of totally random outcomes, you will have several series of continuos “heads” or “tails”. If you charted your flips, those completely random series would look like trends.

Look at the chart above. Does it look like a downtrend? With pullbacks and all, right?

Ready to be surprised?

It is 100% noise. NO SIGNAL AT ALL.

This chart is of an excel randomly generated sequence of 1250 1s and -1s. Completely random. I didn’t cheat, it’s absolutely a random distribution of +1s and -1s. You can check in excel yourself.

Here’s another one I generated with the same algorythm, just by refreshing the random sequence. Looks just like a market chart, doesn’t it? That’s what a totally random sequence (with equal step increments) looks like.

In this sequence, every next step has ZERO correlation with a previous step. Every “price move” has ZERO dependance on the past moves and thus ZERO predictive power.

EVERYTHING that looks like a trend here is 100% noise.

For me it’s mind-blowing every time I look at the charts. Even though I’ve known this for a long time, every time I see it with my own eyes, it’s like a cold shower.

So how can one differentiate the REAL trends?

The question you are asking is a fundamental question of trading. The Holy Grail of trading, if you will. If a trader can differentiate trend and random noise, he’s got the market in his pocket.

It’s not impossible, but when you start to solve that riddle, you get into more and more complexity. Exactly why it takes work and practice and time to learn trading. Different markets behave differently, and then same markets behave differently at different times. Market behaviour “personalities” surprisingly, just like trends, stay realtively stable for a time, but at some moment inevitably shift (just as trends reverse).

Markets are VERY random, yet it has been statisticlly proven that they are not 100% random. In one of the statistical studies I’ve read, the mathematic outcome was that about 2% of market movement is signal, 98% is noise.

Just two things I know for sure:

Trends exist.
    
The signal/noise ratio gets progressively higher with the increase of statistical sampling -> more transactions means more signal -> higher time frames are very significantly less random than smaler ones (though still very random).
